## Carry Select 16-bit

Longest path is Y[2] to S[13] at  17.032

very fast, much speed

all the delay is from input to ouput

33(20800) LUT
11(8150) Slice

takes lots of space

## Ripple Carry 16-bit

Longest path is Y[7] to S[12] at 21.602

not fast, much cringe

16 LUT
7 Slice

not much space, utilization efficient

Carry is good for going fast, but ripple is good for saving space
